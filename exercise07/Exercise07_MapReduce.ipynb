    "## 8. TF-IDF in MapReduce (optional)\n",
    "Imagine we want to build a search engine over the Gutenberg dataset of ~3000 books. Given a word or a set of words, we want to rank these books according their relevance for these words. We need a metric to measure the importance of a word in a set of document...\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.1 Understand TF-IDF\n",
    "\n",
    "[TF-IDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) is a statistic to determine the relative importance of the words in a set of documents. It is computed as the product of two statistics, term frequency (`tf`) and inverse document frequency (`idf`). \n",
    "\n",
    "Given a word `t`, a document `d` (in this case a book) and the collection of all documents `D` we can define `tf(t, d)` as the number of times `t` appears in `d`. This gives us some information about the content of a document but because some terms (eg. \"the\") are so common, term frequency will tend to incorrectly emphasize documents which happen to use the word \"the\" more frequently, without giving enough weight to the more meaningful terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inverse document frequency `idf(t, D)` is a measure of how much information the word provides, that is, whether the term is common or rare across all documents. It can be computed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "![idf](https://bigdata2020exassets.blob.core.windows.net/ex07/idf.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "where $|D|$ is the total number of documents and the denominator represents how many documents contain the word $t$ at least once. However, this would cause a division-by-zero exception if the user query a word that never appear in the dataset. A better formulation would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "![idf](https://bigdata2020exassets.blob.core.windows.net/ex07/idf_smooth.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the `tdidf(t, d, D)` is calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![idf](https://bigdata2020exassets.blob.core.windows.net/ex07/tfidf.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A high weight in `tfidf` is reached by a high term frequency (in the given document) and a low document frequency of the term in the whole collection of documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.2 Implement TF-IDF in MapReduce (pseudo-code)\n",
    "Implement Mapper and Reducer functions in pseudo-code to compute TF-IDF. Assume each Mapper receives the document name as string key and the entire document content as string value. The output of your job should be a list of key-value pairs, where the key is a string in the form \"document:word\" and the value is the `tfidf` score for that document/word pair.\n",
