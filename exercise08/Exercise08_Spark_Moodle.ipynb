That means the development time of each query (time elapsed before you start writing the query, and the time at which the correct, final query is ready). Note that the time part of every question is optional and not graded. In order to make easier the time recording we created two functions that do it automatically. Run the cell below in order to import the functions into the current notebook. Then before each query we will have a ```start_exercise()``` cell that you have to run in order to start time recording. After you have finished your query and you are sure about the answer run the ```finish_exercise()``` one to get the time measurement. "
